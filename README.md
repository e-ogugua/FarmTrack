## Technology Stack

The system utilizes modern web technologies for optimal performance:

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router architecture
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development environment
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-based styling system with accessibility features
- **Framer Motion** - Animation and transition management with reduced motion support
- **IndexedDB** - Primary data persistence layer for offline functionality
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library for consistent interface design

## System Architecture

The platform implements offline-first architecture to ensure reliable operation in environments with limited network connectivity. Data persistence occurs locally with optional synchronization capabilities.

The system maintains clean architectural principles with intuitive user interface design. Each functional module addresses specific operational requirements.

## Developer Guide

### Development Conventions

#### Code Style
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

#### Component Structure
```typescript
// Preferred component pattern
export default React.memo(function ComponentName({ prop }: Props) {
  // Component logic here
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX structure */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

#### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Follow optimistic update patterns

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and utilities
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify accessibility features

#### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between modules
- Ensure proper error handling

### Deployment Process

#### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

#### Deployment Platforms
- **Vercel** - Recommended for Next.js applications
- **Netlify** - Alternative deployment platform
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment option

#### Environment Configuration
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Configure production database connections
- Enable monitoring and error tracking
