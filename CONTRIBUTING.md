# Contributing to FarmTrack

This document provides guidelines for contributing to FarmTrack, an agricultural management system developed as part of the EmmanuelOS ecosystem.

## Development Philosophy

FarmTrack follows software engineering best practices with a focus on:

- **Reliability** - Consistent operation across environments
- **Maintainability** - Code structure supporting future enhancements
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all users
- **Performance** - Optimized bundle sizes and loading times
- **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or later
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git and GitHub account

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/farmtrack.git
cd farmtrack

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Implement Changes
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Implement proper accessibility features
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint

# Build verification
npm run build
```

### 4. Submit Pull Request
- Provide clear description of changes
- Reference related issues
- Include testing instructions
- Update documentation

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces for all data structures
- Implement error handling with proper typing
- Use generic types where appropriate

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Preferred component pattern
interface Props {
  // Define required and optional props
}

export default React.memo(function ComponentName({ prop }: Props) {
  // Component logic with proper hooks usage
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Accessible JSX structure */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local state management
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Follow optimistic update patterns for better UX
- Avoid prop drilling with context where appropriate

### Accessibility Requirements
- Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Add proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Test with screen readers
- Respect user motion preferences

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and utilities
- Mock external dependencies (IndexedDB, APIs)
- Verify accessibility features
- Test error handling scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between modules
- Ensure proper error propagation
- Test offline functionality

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Responsive design across all breakpoints
- [ ] Keyboard navigation functionality
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Touch target sizes (minimum 44px)
- [ ] Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences

## Performance Standards

### Bundle Size Targets
- Main bundle: Under 120kB
- Individual feature bundles: Optimized for loading
- Static assets: Compressed and optimized

### Loading Performance
- First Contentful Paint: Under 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: Under 2.5s
- Time to Interactive: Under 3.5s

### Code Splitting
- Dynamic imports for large components
- Lazy loading for non-critical features
- Progressive enhancement patterns

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex business logic
- Include usage examples for utilities
- Update type definitions for new interfaces

### Feature Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Document API changes
- Include migration guides for breaking changes
- Update installation and setup instructions

## Review Process

### Pull Request Requirements
- Clear description of changes and rationale
- Tests included for new functionality
- Documentation updates included
- Accessibility considerations addressed
- Performance impact assessed

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Type safety verified
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Tests included and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Responsive design verified
- [ ] Error handling implemented

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (browser, OS, version)
- Error messages and stack traces

### Feature Requests
- Detailed description of the feature
- Use case and business rationale

- Acceptance criteria

## Deployment Guidelines

### Production Deployment
- Use production-optimized build
- Configure proper environment variables
- Enable monitoring and error tracking
- Test deployment in staging environment

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Support and Communication

### Development Discussions
- Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests
- Join development discussions for technical topics
- Follow established communication channels

### Technical Support
- Report system issues through standard channels
- Provide detailed information for troubleshooting
- Include relevant logs and error messages
